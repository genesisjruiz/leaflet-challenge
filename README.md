# Module 15 Challenge: Interactive Earthquake Visualization

For this challenge, I utilized data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to visualize an earthquake dataset. The project involves creating interactive maps using JavaScript and the D3 library. By employing GeoJSON—a JSON format designed for geographical data—I've built an interactive map to display earthquake data.

## Repository Structure

- **Folder: `leaflet-challenge`**
  - **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that, when run, displays the Earthquake Visualization based on the dataset provided by USGS. [USGS Earthquake Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson)
  
  - **Folders:**
    - **`Static`**: Contains the `style.css` and `logic.js` files for styling and scripting the map.
    - **`Images`**: Includes screenshots of the visualization displayed on an Edge web browser, as well as a screenshot demonstrating the functionality of the circle marker popup.
    - **`.vscode`**: Contains a `launch.json` configuration file used for debugging in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
